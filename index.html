                Aegis combines physiological horror with an ancient Greek setting to produce a first-person 3D survival
                thriller game that terrifies players.
                Players are thrown into the game when they find themselves falling into the ruined temple of Medusa and
                must solve puzzles within the environment to escape.
                The player is not alone however, as they are hunted by living statues that try to prevent them from
                escaping.
                The statues lurk in the dark temple, only moving when the player blinks or turns their back.
